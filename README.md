# Franklin Debt Advisor

An interactive web application that allows users to ask Benjamin Franklin questions about the U.S. national debt. The application uses GPT-4 to generate responses in Franklin's voice, ElevenLabs to convert the text to speech, and D-ID to animate a portrait of Benjamin Franklin.

## Features

- Ask questions about the U.S. national debt
- Get responses from Benjamin Franklin with accurate facts
- See and hear an animated Benjamin Franklin delivering the response

## Tech Stack

- React/Next.js for the frontend and API routes
- OpenAI GPT-4 for generating Franklin's responses
- ElevenLabs for text-to-speech generation
- D-ID for avatar animation

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key
   DID_API_KEY=your_did_api_key
   ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=your_custom_ben_franklin_voice_id
   BEN_FRANKLIN_IMAGE_URL=https://your-bucket.com/benjamin-franklin.jpg
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## API Implementation Notes

### Storage Service

This project requires a file storage service for the audio files generated by ElevenLabs before they are sent to D-ID. In a production environment, you would implement file uploads to a service like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Cloudinary.

The current implementation includes a mock function `uploadAudioToStorage` that should be replaced with actual upload logic to your chosen storage service.

### Rate Limits and Error Handling

All three external APIs (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, and D-ID) have rate limits. In a production environment, consider implementing:

- Rate limiting for your API
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Queue system for managing multiple requests
